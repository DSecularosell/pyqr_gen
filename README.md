# This is a qr generator using pyqrcode. I am hoping to make this into a useful program for my non-profit theatre company README.md

It currently exists as a simple cli to print a png of the qr code made from the user input

## Future plans

I want to make a GUI and hopefully control the output location through user input, currently it just takes a url and asks for a filename
